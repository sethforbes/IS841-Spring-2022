## Warmup Supervised Data Challenge

- Server address:  http://34.150.129.108:8501/
- Apply a model of your choice to the training set and upload your predictions
- Keep only the id and prediction column.  There is a sample file for you to review.


## Unsupervised ML - Clustering

- KMeans - We define the clusters based on K.  This will introduce our ability to interate 
- Hierarchical Clulstering (Agglomerative) - Bottom-up approach, clusters all records and we determine what is the correct number of clusters for our problem
- DBSCAN - Can determine outliers but requires my tuning (not as clear cut as Kmeans and HClust)
