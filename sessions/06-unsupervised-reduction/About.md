- KMeans - We define the clusters based on K.  This will introduce our ability to interate 
- Hierarchical Clulstering (Agglomerative) - Bottom-up approach, clusters all records and we determine what is the correct number of clusters for our problem
- DBSCAN - Can determine outliers but requires my tuning (not as clear cut as Kmeans and HClust)
