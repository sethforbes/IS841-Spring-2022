To do this, you have to have Jupyter installed on a machine. The actual notebook interface is \"served up\" by that local machine as a web service that you can access through a web browser. If you click the play button next to a \"cell\" of code, it will instruct the server machine to execute that line of code in a shell that is awaiting input and then send the output back to the browser.  Google provides a Jupyter notebook environment that is connected to Google's cloud computing service that you can use for free (with some limitations) through colab.research.google.com. This is what you are using to look at this lecture now.\n",
