# IS841 - Advanced Business Analytics: Data Mining - Spring 2022

This repo contains the materials for a course in unsupervised machine learning and text analytics with python.  Students should plan to close this repo and pull the most recent changes before each class meeting.

This class will use Blackboard for:

- Assignment submission and exams
- Larger Annoucements
- Gradebook
- Examples of assignment submissions, team project references, and test formats.

The majority of the resources will be found here in this repo, that will be constantly updated over the course of the semester.  

> I will also be making use of the Discussions section on the Github Repo.  This will act as public discussions and forums for topics specific to this class. I have found that Q&A style forums have worked well in my past deliveries of the course, as it centers the conversations on specific topics.



## Schedule

Each class session is as follows (Boston-local time):

- Thursdays 6:30-9:15 in room HAR 310
